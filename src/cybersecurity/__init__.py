Cybersecurity module for managing multi-framework data ingestion and processing.

This module provides ingestion capabilities for multiple cybersecurity frameworks:
- MITRE ATT&CK: Tactics, techniques, and procedures
- CIS Controls v8.1: Implementation groups and safeguards  
- NIST CSF 2.0: Functions, categories, and subcategories
- HIPAA Administrative Simplification: Regulations and compliance
- FFIEC IT Handbook: Banking cybersecurity guidance
- PCI DSS v4.0.1: Payment card security standards

Each framework has its own dedicated ingestion module with standardized
interfaces for data processing and graph database integration.
