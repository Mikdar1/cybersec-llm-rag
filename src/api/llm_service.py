Large Language Model Integration Service Module

This module provides integration with Google's Gemini LLM for cybersecurity
intelligence analysis and chatbot functionality. It handles LLM initialization,
prompt templating, and context-aware response generation using the MITRE ATT&CK
knowledge base.

Features:
- Google Gemini LLM integration via LangChain
- Cybersecurity-specialized prompt templates
- Context-aware response generation
- ATT&CK knowledge base integration

Functions:
    get_llm: LLM factory and configuration
    chat_with_knowledge_base: Main chat interface with context injection
